## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start development server

```bash
ng serve
```
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Building

Create a production-ready build:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

### Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
